# Style Transfer with PyTorch

This repository contains a Python implementation of neural style transfer using PyTorch. Neural style transfer is a technique in machine learning that applies the style of one image to the content of another image, producing a stylized image that combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another.

## Project Overview

This project uses a pre-trained VGG19 model to perform style transfer. The implementation leverages PyTorch to optimize the combination of content and style images to produce a final stylized image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the style transfer

Execute the script model.py to perform the style transfer:

```bash
python model.py
